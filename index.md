## **Professional Self-Assessment**

 Hello all, my name is Graham Swenson and I currently reside in the Midwest and attend Southern New Hampshire University online. In this self-assessment I will answer the following questions. First, I will discuss how completing my coursework throughout the program and developing my ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals, and become more employable in the computer science field. I will do this by using specific examples from my program and include examples that are outside of my ePortfolio. Next, I will address collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security, all different aspects of computer science. I will then summarize and introduce how my artifacts fit together.
	
 In this first paragraph I will discuss how completing my coursework and developing my ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths. During my coursework I was able to discover that my strength lay in a few specializations. Those being embedded software engineering, project management, and java based databases. First, I was drawn to embedded software engineering because of the logic that is often tied with that form of coding. I appreciate discrete mathematics and its application to everyday situations. I live in an area where there is a lot of farming equipment, and I often think about how the different embedded modules are used to actuate different components on the combines or farming implements. The two classes that helped me discover this strength were CS350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies and MAT230 Discrete Mathematics. The next strength I was able to discover was my knack for project management. Specifically working in an agile environment on a mock scrum team. I was specifically drawn to the role of product owner or the scrum master. Both jobs allow me to apply skills I have gained at my current employer or when I was in a leadership position in the military. A specific example outside of my ePortfolio is I have been promoted to a project management position at my current employer. Using the skills I gained from this school and doing research on my own, I was able to gain the necessary skills to undertake more responsibilities at work. One of the last strengths I will discuss here is java-based databases. I appreciate the language of Java and its lightweight versatility for creating databases. I have found myself going through life at home or work and realizing that I could “make a database for that”. Maybe it is a compulsion to organize items in a manner that makes sense to me, but I have found that I appreciate the plug and play abilities for making databases with Java. Additionally, I have been able to take the agile method, that I’ve learned in many different classes during my computer science courses, into my current work. Collaborating in a team environment, I can use principles from the “agile manifesto” to divide a project into manageable slices and assign them to the employee that has the appropriate strengths. Additionally, I have gained experience in communicating complex topics to lay individuals who are not familiar with technical terminology. Explaining a static vs. dynamic database to an individual that can’t tell the difference is a deciding factor in today’s job market. While the specific knowledge varies, being able to explain these complex topics in simple and concise ways allows for better work productivity between different sections, within an organization. During my coursework at SNHU, I’ve developed a good foundation in common data structures like arrays or linked lists. Additionally, I’ve gained the ability to develop robust and scalable applications using the object-oriented programing method. In relation to security, I’ve also gained the ability to write programs using secure coding practices. In today’s climate the ability to protect your program is a necessity. Malicious actors are indiscriminate in their desire to take bad actions against organizations and individuals. 
	
 In this next paragraph I will begin by summarizing and introducing how my artifacts fit together. In this ePortfolio you will see three separate sections that are covered, those are software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. For software design and engineering I selected my final project for SNHU course CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. This is straightforward code that allows me to showcase my ability to write clean code that is functional and concise. The next section is titled algorithms and data structures, for this section I chose my C code for an embedded module from SNHU course CS350: Emerging Systems, Architectures, and Technologies. This shows my ability to engineering code for an embedded technology and do so in a logical and clean manner. Finally, the last section that is addressed in this ePortfolio is the databases section. For databases I was able to use my final project from SNHU course IT145: Foundation in Application Development. While the final project did not see us code any actual program, we created pseudocode and a map for this program. Being that this was a level 100 course, I wanted to come full circle and make this program; while also improving on it.

###### Background:
I wanted to perform a code review so that I could gain an encompassing picture of what I was working with. The following code review was instrumental in ensuring that I knew what needed to be enhanced. I was able to quickly ascertain what gaps I had in my code and what improvements could be made.

**Original**
- Original [OriginalContact.java](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/OriginalContact.java).
- Oritinal [OriginalContactService.java](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/OriginalContactService.java).

###### Narrative: 
 
 In this narrative I will be explaining the enhancements I have made to my final project java code for CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. I will do this by answering the following prompts; first I will briefly describe the artifact, what it was and when it was created. Next, I will justify the inclusion of the artifact into my ePortfolio. Why I selected the item, what specific components of the artifact showcase my skills and abilities and how the artifact has improved. Thirdly, I will state if I met course outcomes, I wanted to meet in Module One. Additionally, do I have any updates on my outcome-coverage plans. Finally, I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. I will state what I learned as I was creating it and what challenges I faced. 
	
 In this first section, I will briefly describe the artifact I am using for the Software Design and Engineering section. I am using my java code from the CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance class. The java code I originally created for the class was for the purpose of testing the code, therefore the code lacks certain aspects one would see as standard for the type of program developed. The java code creates an arrayed list of contact information for people. Which in turn has a separate java class that manages this arrayed list. This was a set of java classes we used in the course to test, I believe using JUnit tests. This was created approximately a year or two ago for my coursework.
	
 In this second section, I will justify my inclusion of this artifact into my ePortfolio. I selected this item because it allows me to display my clean coding abilities. It shows how I can write informative in-line statements, displays my ability to utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The specific components that are displayed are my abilities to write a code that does not crash or error because of a null and displays simple logic for creating entry level arrayed lists. This artifact has improved immensely because it shows that I now know how to write proper java code and use in-line commands to tell others what I am doing (or think I am doing); when I am writing my code. 
	
 In this section I will state if I met the course outcomes, I planned on meeting in Module One. In Module One I planned on meeting course outcomes 3, 4, and 5. Those being designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles, Demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools; then finally I stated that I would develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits. I believe that I have covered the fifth outcome which is developing a security mindset when writing this code. This was done be using input validation and ensuring my program does not inadvertently crash due to null pointer exception. I also believe that I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques and skills. An example of this is because I used the “Optional” handling for a potentially null value; within my Contact.java class. Based on my research, this is a modern approach to managing how my class handles the data set. Finally, I believe that I designed a computing solution to solve a given problem. The ContactService.java class effectively uses different methods to manipulate the data in an efficient manner. The use of an arrayed list shows I am able to understand performance concerns. If necessary for this course, I can also perform more enhancements to meet this criteria or the criteria of other course outcomes.
	
 In this final paragraph, I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying my artifact. I learned so far, while creating and improving it, that a lot of the skills I have developed in the software engineering space are becoming more natural to me. In-line comments and secure coding practices seem like no brainers when I am constructing a method, class, or program. It feels good that coding practices I struggled earlier with seem easier to grasp now. The challenges I faced were looking into what people are currently doing with java. I believe that there is so much more for me to learn, and it was challenging trying to take it all in.



### **Part 2: Algorithms and Data Sructures**

*This section is in reference to the following code:*

**Original**
- Original [Originalgpiointerrupt.c](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/Originalgpiointerrupt.c)

**Enhanced**
- Enhanced [gpiointerrupt.c](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/gpiointerrupt.c)

###### Narrative: 

 In this narrative I will discussing the following prompts; first I will briefly describe the artifact. Secondly, I will justify the inclusion of the artifact in my ePortfolio. I will say why I selected the item, what specific components of the artifact showcase my skills and abilities for algorithms and data structure. Then, I will state if I met course outcomes that I planned to meet in my Module One outline; I will also provide any updates to my outcome-coverage plans. Finally, I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did I learn as I was creating it and improving it.
	
 First, I will describe the artifact; this C code is code I used in the course CS350: Emerging Systems, Architectures, and Technologies to provide logic for an embedded controller. Specifically, this code is used to control a Texas Instruments micro-controller that displays different flashing lights based off the temperature. This was created a year ago by me for this course, with aid from the course work. 
	
 I am using this artifact in my ePortfolio because I enjoy embedded software engineering and two, there are lots of organizations around where I live that utilize technology from embedded software companies. I live in a rural farming area and all modern farming implementations use multiple facets of embedded software engineering. Therefore, it was included in my ePortfolio so I could provide a relevant experience base for local organizations. The specific components of this artifact that show my skills in the algorithms and data structure category is the use of dynamic memory allocations for “sensors” and “malloc”, which showcases my understanding of dynamic memory allocation. Next, I used time driven task scheduling to trigger specific events with the function “timerCallback”. Additionally, I defined a sensor structure that demonstrates I know how to implement user-defined data types to organize data. The artifact was improved because I changed the code from a static array to a dynamic array. 
	
 In this next section, I will state if I met the course outcomes, I planned to meet with the enhancement in Module One. The original course outcomes I intended to meet in Module One were outcomes three and four; those being design and evaluate computing solutions to solve a given problem. Then it is to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills and tools in computing practices. I believe that I met both of those requirements, and I also met outcome two, which refers to develop and deliver professional quality communications in a coherent manner. I believe I accomplished this by making a working program with the relevant in-line statements, so other engineers can understand what I have made.
	
 In this final paragraph I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. I did learn how to make a dynamic array in this process, and I now understand better the benefits of dynamic arrays. First their ability to “grow” or “shrink” based upon a given set is important for efficient machine usage. The challenges I faced was how do I transfer any error handling, so my program doesn’t crash and works properly. 


### **Part 3: Databases**

*This section is in reference to the following code:*

**Original**
- (pseudocode only) [Original](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/CS499%20-%20Part3%20(IT145)%20doc.docx)

**Enhanced**
- Enhanced [PetCheckInSystem.java](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/PetCheckInSystem.java)

###### Narrative: 

 In this narrative I will provide an overview of my third artifact, that being the category of databases. I will describe what I used and how I enhanced it. I will do this by first describing what the original artifact is and when it was created. Next, I will justify the including of the artifact into my ePortfolio, why I selected the item, what specific components I wanted to showcase and how the artifact improved. Then, I will state How I met the course outcomes I planned to meet in module one. Then, I will state if I have any update to my outcome-coverage plan. Finally, I will end this reflection by reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. 
	
 In this first paragraph I will describe the original artifact and when it was created. The original artifact was from my class IT145: Foundation in Application Development. This final project was a paper where one of the tasks I did was to complete pseudocode for a java database. This java database was to obtain information for a pet hotel that could watch your dogs or cats. This class was taken very early on in the coursework I completed to get my bachelor’s degree. Looking back at my academic evaluation, I completed this class in the winter of 2022. 
	
 I included this in my ePortfolio because I thought it was a fun way to show how my skills have improved from theorizing code, to actually writing it. I also selected this item because it was a fun platform for making a database. The specific components I wanted to showcase was the ability to write java code, write clean java code, incorporate simple logic, and finally incorporate data mining into the code. I improved this artifact by writing it and by adding datamining into the logic. 
	
 The course outcomes that I said I wanted to meet for this artifact in module one was the first, third, and fourth course outcomes. I believe that I have covered the first course outcome, which emphasizes building a collaborative environment that enables diverse audiences to support organization decision making. That is because I made a data mining output that displays values for making the business better. That means that people who may not have written the code or built the logic, can have a hand in making organization decisions; by viewing the data sheet. I also believe that this design uses algorithmic principes and computer science practices to accomplish the solution. Finally, I doo believe that I demonstrated well-found techniques that implement computer science solutions. Those being arrayed lists and simple logic in the java language. 
	
 Finally I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. This was fun to write this program, I enjoyed expounding on simple work I created two years ago. What I learned during this process was creating data mining. I had never actually done direct data mining in my programs before, so it was a good mental exercise working on it. The challenges I faced was to incorporate the data mining. I had to do research on how to write that type of code and some of the coding best practices that came along with it.
