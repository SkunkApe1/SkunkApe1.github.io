 ###### Narrative:
 
 In this narrative I will be explaining the enhancements I have made to my final project java code for CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. I will do this by answering the following prompts; first I will briefly describe the artifact, what it was and when it was created. Next, I will justify the inclusion of the artifact into my ePortfolio. Why I selected the item, what specific components of the artifact showcase my skills and abilities and how the artifact has improved. Thirdly, I will state if I met course outcomes, I wanted to meet in Module One. Additionally, do I have any updates on my outcome-coverage plans. Finally, I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. I will state what I learned as I was creating it and what challenges I faced. 
	
 In this first section, I will briefly describe the artifact I am using for the Software Design and Engineering section. I am using my java code from the CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance class. The java code I originally created for the class was for the purpose of testing the code, therefore the code lacks certain aspects one would see as standard for the type of program developed. The java code creates an arrayed list of contact information for people. Which in turn has a separate java class that manages this arrayed list. This was a set of java classes we used in the course to test, I believe using JUnit tests. This was created approximately a year or two ago for my coursework.
	
 In this second section, I will justify my inclusion of this artifact into my ePortfolio. I selected this item because it allows me to display my clean coding abilities. It shows how I can write informative in-line statements, displays my ability to utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The specific components that are displayed are my abilities to write a code that does not crash or error because of a null and displays simple logic for creating entry level arrayed lists. This artifact has improved immensely because it shows that I now know how to write proper java code and use in-line commands to tell others what I am doing (or think I am doing); when I am writing my code. 
	
 In this section I will state if I met the course outcomes, I planned on meeting in Module One. In Module One I planned on meeting course outcomes 3, 4, and 5. Those being designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles, Demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools; then finally I stated that I would develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits. I believe that I have covered the fifth outcome which is developing a security mindset when writing this code. This was done be using input validation and ensuring my program does not inadvertently crash due to null pointer exception. I also believe that I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques and skills. An example of this is because I used the “Optional” handling for a potentially null value; within my Contact.java class. Based on my research, this is a modern approach to managing how my class handles the data set. Finally, I believe that I designed a computing solution to solve a given problem. The ContactService.java class effectively uses different methods to manipulate the data in an efficient manner. The use of an arrayed list shows I am able to understand performance concerns. If necessary for this course, I can also perform more enhancements to meet this criteria or the criteria of other course outcomes.
	
 In this final paragraph, I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying my artifact. I learned so far, while creating and improving it, that a lot of the skills I have developed in the software engineering space are becoming more natural to me. In-line comments and secure coding practices seem like no brainers when I am constructing a method, class, or program. It feels good that coding practices I struggled earlier with seem easier to grasp now. The challenges I faced were looking into what people are currently doing with java. I believe that there is so much more for me to learn, and it was challenging trying to take it all in.



### **Part 2: Algorithms and Data Sructures**

*This section is in reference to the following code:*

**Original**
- Original [Originalgpiointerrupt.c](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/Originalgpiointerrupt.c)

**Enhanced**
- Enhanced [gpiointerrupt.c](https://github.com/SkunkApe1/SkunkApe1.github.io/blob/main/gpiointerrupt.c)

###### Narrative: 

 In this narrative I will discussing the following prompts; first I will briefly describe the artifact. Secondly, I will justify the inclusion of the artifact in my ePortfolio. I will say why I selected the item, what specific components of the artifact showcase my skills and abilities for algorithms and data structure. Then, I will state if I met course outcomes that I planned to meet in my Module One outline; I will also provide any updates to my outcome-coverage plans. Finally, I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did I learn as I was creating it and improving it.
	
 First, I will describe the artifact; this C code is code I used in the course CS350: Emerging Systems, Architectures, and Technologies to provide logic for an embedded controller. Specifically, this code is used to control a Texas Instruments micro-controller that displays different flashing lights based off the temperature. This was created a year ago by me for this course, with aid from the course work. 
	
 I am using this artifact in my ePortfolio because I enjoy embedded software engineering and two, there are lots of organizations around where I live that utilize technology from embedded software companies. I live in a rural farming area and all modern farming implementations use multiple facets of embedded software engineering. Therefore, it was included in my ePortfolio so I could provide a relevant experience base for local organizations. The specific components of this artifact that show my skills in the algorithms and data structure category is the use of dynamic memory allocations for “sensors” and “malloc”, which showcases my understanding of dynamic memory allocation. Next, I used time driven task scheduling to trigger specific events with the function “timerCallback”. Additionally, I defined a sensor structure that demonstrates I know how to implement user-defined data types to organize data. The artifact was improved because I changed the code from a static array to a dynamic array. 
	
 In this next section, I will state if I met the course outcomes, I planned to meet with the enhancement in Module One. The original course outcomes I intended to meet in Module One were outcomes three and four; those being design and evaluate computing solutions to solve a given problem. Then it is to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills and tools in computing practices. I believe that I met both of those requirements, and I also met outcome two, which refers to develop and deliver professional quality communications in a coherent manner. I believe I accomplished this by making a working program with the relevant in-line statements, so other engineers can understand what I have made.
	
 In this final paragraph I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. I did learn how to make a dynamic array in this process, and I now understand better the benefits of dynamic arrays. First their ability to “grow” or “shrink” based upon a given set is important for efficient machine usage. The challenges I faced was how do I transfer any error handling, so my program doesn’t crash and works properly. 


### **Part 3: Databases**

###### Narrative: 

 In this narrative I will provide an overview of my third artifact, that being the category of databases. I will describe what I used and how I enhanced it. I will do this by first describing what the original artifact is and when it was created. Next, I will justify the including of the artifact into my ePortfolio, why I selected the item, what specific components I wanted to showcase and how the artifact improved. Then, I will state How I met the course outcomes I planned to meet in module one. Then, I will state if I have any update to my outcome-coverage plan. Finally, I will end this reflection by reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. 
	
 In this first paragraph I will describe the original artifact and when it was created. The original artifact was from my class IT145: Foundation in Application Development. This final project was a paper where one of the tasks I did was to complete pseudocode for a java database. This java database was to obtain information for a pet hotel that could watch your dogs or cats. This class was taken very early on in the coursework I completed to get my bachelor’s degree. Looking back at my academic evaluation, I completed this class in the winter of 2022. 
	
 I included this in my ePortfolio because I thought it was a fun way to show how my skills have improved from theorizing code, to actually writing it. I also selected this item because it was a fun platform for making a database. The specific components I wanted to showcase was the ability to write java code, write clean java code, incorporate simple logic, and finally incorporate data mining into the code. I improved this artifact by writing it and by adding datamining into the logic. 
	
 The course outcomes that I said I wanted to meet for this artifact in module one was the first, third, and fourth course outcomes. I believe that I have covered the first course outcome, which emphasizes building a collaborative environment that enables diverse audiences to support organization decision making. That is because I made a data mining output that displays values for making the business better. That means that people who may not have written the code or built the logic, can have a hand in making organization decisions; by viewing the data sheet. I also believe that this design uses algorithmic principes and computer science practices to accomplish the solution. Finally, I doo believe that I demonstrated well-found techniques that implement computer science solutions. Those being arrayed lists and simple logic in the java language. 
	
 Finally I will reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. This was fun to write this program, I enjoyed expounding on simple work I created two years ago. What I learned during this process was creating data mining. I had never actually done direct data mining in my programs before, so it was a good mental exercise working on it. The challenges I faced was to incorporate the data mining. I had to do research on how to write that type of code and some of the coding best practices that came along with it.
